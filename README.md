## Launch Your Site
Once you've set up your configuration and content, you can preview your site locally or build it for deployment.

### Serve locally for development:
This starts a local web server, typically at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, that auto-reloads when you make changes.
```bash
mkdocs serve
```

### Build for production:
This command creates a static `site` directory with all the HTML, CSS, and JS files, ready to be deployed to any web host.
```bash
mkdocs build
```

### Deploy to GitHub Pages:
This command deploys to github pages `https//blutterfly.github.io/mkdocs_guide` 
```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```
